Playground Books Jardim Harmônico, aprenda sobre escalas musicais!

Hello, my name is Juliano and I am a 7th semester Computer Science undergraduate student (may 2020). I love music and educational technologies. That way, my playgrounds project is a simple learning game about the musical scales. In my playground, you can build your Harmonic Garden, (in portuguese, Jardim Harmônico), by watering plants with musical species seeds! For each plant pot, you need to plant a seed of a certain specie[SCALE], and then, for it to grow up, you will need to strengthen it with vitamin[NOTE]s. But be careful! With the wrong vitamin[NOTE], which is not part of the specie[SCALE], your plant will die and it will be necessary to restart your Harmonic Garden.
