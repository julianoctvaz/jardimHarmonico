## jardimHarmonico Playground Project
#### Learning about the musical scale


Hello, my name is Juliano and I am a Computer Science undergraduate student. I love music and educational technologies. That way, my playground project is a simple learning game about the musical scales. In my playground, you can build your Harmonic Garden, (in portuguese, Jardim Harm√¥nico), by watering plants with musical species seeds! For each plant pot, you need to plant a seed of a certain specie[SCALE], and then, for it to grow up, you will need to strengthen it with vitamin[NOTE]s. But be careful! With the wrong vitamin[NOTE], which is not part of the specie[SCALE], your plant will die and it will be necessary to restart your Harmonic Garden.
