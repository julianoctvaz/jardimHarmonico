//: Like many musical scales, it is made up of **seven notes**: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that  it is called a higher octave of the same note.
//: In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch.
//: A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale.
//: Here we will just learn scales **ordered by ascending pitch**.
//: A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. Its explained in  **onboarding** when you execute the game, so, lets back to Home Page and play the  **playground**!
