Hello, my name is Juliano Cezar Teles Vaz and love music and educational technologies.
Currently I am developer at Apple Developer Academy e we have been learning a lof of technologies and frameworks by Apple. Also, I am studying Computer Science at the Informatics Center (CIn) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). I chose this project to submit, because it is special to me, last year I had not finished it yet to submit and was my fisrt solo project in the Apple Developer Academy - Recife, Brazil.
We used Challenge-based Learning (CBL) methodology and I literally saw my mind blown up when i concreted this idea! I show it for anyone with proud! I until made this [article](https://medium.com/academyufpe/sobre-ter-boas-ideias-menos-eureka-e-mais-t%C3%A9cnicas-e-m%C3%A9todos-8e899ffbdda7) in Medium to share my experience about the ideation, prototyping, and development.
